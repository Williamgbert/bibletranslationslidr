Got it. What you pasted is React + Tailwind code, which won’t run directly as plain HTML because React handles state (useState), conditional rendering, and component logic. To “turn it into HTML,” I’ll flatten it into a static HTML + CSS + JavaScript version that runs in a browser without React or imports. It won’t have JSX, imports, or useState—instead, we’ll use vanilla JavaScript to manage the slider logic.

Here’s a working HTML conversion of your code:

This does what your React code does—slider updates the displayed translation, spectrum label, and color—just without React.

Do you want me to also remove Tailwind and rewrite the CSS so it’s fully standalone (pure HTML + CSS + JS), or do you prefer to keep Tailwind since it makes styling lighter?
